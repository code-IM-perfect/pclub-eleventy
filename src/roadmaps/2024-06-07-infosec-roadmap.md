# Roadmap to Information Security

### What is Information Security?

Information Security is not only about securing information from unauthorized access. Information Security is basically the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording, or destruction of information. Information can be physical or electronic. Information can be anything like your details or, we can say, your profile on social media, your data in mobile phone, your biometrics, etc. Thus, Information Security spans so many research areas like Cryptography, Mobile Computing, Cyber Forensics, Online Social Media, etc.

### Why learn Information Security?

Information security involves considering available countermeasures or controls stimulated through uncovered vulnerabilities and identifying areas where more work is needed. The need for Information security includes:

- Protecting the functionality of the organization
- Enabling the safe operation of applications
- Protecting the data that the organization collects and uses
- Safeguarding technology assets in organizations

_Note:_ In case of any doubts while going through this roadmap, You
can post your query on the Infosec Channel on the discord server of
Programming Club, IIT Kanpur. The roadmap is more inclined towards the
offensive side of infosec.

## Week 1 ( Computer Organisation and Fundamentals)

To dive into the field of Information security, one first needs to
understand the basic fundamentals like how computers, networks and other
things work. To break the rule, you need to know the rule. But, to make
it secure you need to understand the rule.

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1      | Computers only understand 0s and 1s, so first we need to understand [Number system](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/number/Numeral_system.html) ( Binary, Octal, Decimal and Hexadecimal).<br/><br/> Computers are good with 0s and 1s, but we need some other system to represent other symbols. [ASCII encoding](https://www.ascii-code.com/)                                                                                                                                              |
| Day 2      | First you need to understand the device on which you will work. Since, it lets you know how exactly each instruction is executed at micro level.<br/><br/> Cover the complete [Computer Component](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-components) and [Computer Memory](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-memory) heading and all its subheadings.                                                                                                                                         |
| Day 3      | Most of us use android in our day to day life. So, it becomes really important to have basic android fundamentals, which you can read [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>). Must cover the [FEATURES](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Features>) and [DEVELOPMENT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Development>) sections.                                                                                  |
| Day 4      | Network security is one of the most important aspects to consider when working over the internet, LAN or other method. While there is no network that is immune to attacks, a stable and efficient network security system is essential to protect client data. But, before that we need to know the network fundamentals, which you can cover [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tutorials/).<br/><br/> Must cover BASICS and NETWORK SECURITY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY headings. |
| Day 5      | There are different methodologies used in the field of cybersecurity. To secure a system against a particular method you need to know it. You can read some of them [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-hacking/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Day 6      | Before we proceed further, we need to know about [operating systems](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operating-system-OS) and why to choose [linux over windows](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/linux-vs-windows/).<br/><br/> [Here](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/popular-linux-distributions/), you can get an overview of the popular linux distros available. Now, you will [Install Kali Linux in VirtualBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGTD6jmYhc).         |
| Day 7      | Building and working with the fundamentals can be tedious sometimes. So, you need tools developed by cyber communities over years to tackle problems easily. You can learn about different [important tools](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-kali-linux-tools-for-hacking/) that are used in the security field.                                                                                                                                                                         |

### TASKS:

1. Develop a Base 12 Number System.
2. Convert your name (ASCII text) to base 2, 8, 10, 12, and 16 number systems.
3. Identify network devices around you and figure out what purpose they serve and how.
4. Install a different OS distro in the VirtualBox, run some services, and test it with the tools installed in the first OS and test it with the tools installed in the first OS.

## Week 2: More on Linux, Python and Bash

Throughout the journey exploring info-security the Linux operating
system will play a very crucial role may it be from initially getting
onto challenges or till the reverse engineering. And thus, it becomes
important to have a good understanding of Linux - the basic commands,
and thus, the Unix filesystem.

And Python & bash are scripting languages and really helpful when it
comes to automating the facilities of an existing system. This will be
very useful, while searching for some critical keywords, in a very big
file, for example.

| Day 1 & 2  | Linux Fundamentals<br/> Basic commands: To access the Linux OS from the terminal, you must know some basic commands. Like given [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/977876748475707444/979451763067338752/8938af4-1.png?width=415&height=605).<br/><br/> Unix Filesystem<br/> When working with Linux, it becomes important to understand the filesystem and the hierarchy tree, this will be useful till RE as well.<br/> Which can be covered from [here](https://homepages.uc.edu/~thomam/Intro_Unix_Text/File_System.html).                                                                     |
| Day 3 & 4  | OverTheWire: Bandit [[Link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) ] <br/><br/> These are interesting level-based challenges that will help you learn useful commands! This will help you understand how powerful and useful the terminal is!<br/><br/> “... You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you are supposed to do. Don’t panic! Don’t give up! The purpose of this game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics is reading a lot of new information …” [It is recommended to read through the instructions and manual pages before getting started!] |
| Day 5      | Python<br/>It will be used in scripting, like for searching some flags, when it will not be possible to do so manually.<br/><br/> Basic Python - [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)<br/><br/> Python for scripting and automation: [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/scripting)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Day 6      | Bash scripting<br/><br/> Bash scripting is one of the easiest types of scripting to learn, and is best compared to Windows Batch scripting. Bash is very flexible, and has many advanced features that you won’t see in batch scripts.<br/><br/> Learn Bash scripting - see this [article](https://linuxhint.com/3hr_bash_tutorial/) or [check this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting).                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Day 7      | Practising scripting<br/><br/> Here are some examples on python scripting: [Link](https://linuxhint.com/python_scripts_beginners_guide/), you should try solving them on your own.<br/><br/> To practise bash scripting, you can check [this website](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash), it has some good exercises for practice, or [this](https://tryhackme.com/room/bashscripting) also.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### What’s Next?

Information security is designed to protect the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of computer systems and physical data from
unauthorised access whether with malicious intent or not.

Noone becomes a successful Information Security person overnight, days,
weeks or months; it takes years; it’s a continuous process of learning,
revising and adapting. Emerging technologies and cyber-threats will
continue to evolve. Data breaches and security incidents will happen.
Rather than putting a full stop, one needs to follow up with the
emerging methods and technologies.

Connect with the infosec community, build your team, participate in
events, ctfs, hackathons, bug bounties; learn about new vulnerabilities,
read research papers about security and most important practice what you
learn in a safe environment, causing no data loss or system failure.
