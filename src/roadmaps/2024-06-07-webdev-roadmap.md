# Roadmap to Web Development

### What is Web Development?

Web Development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites on the internet. It can be broadly classified into frontend and backend development. Frontend Development means writing code that your browser will run, whereas backend code runs on a server.

### Why learn Web Development?

Web Development is easy to start with and introduces you to a variety of programming concepts. It even introduces you to the most popular programming language in the world i.e JavaScript. Secondly, it is an evergreen skill, the internet isn’t going to disappear anytime soon, after all. Also it is a good way to deploy projects related to other domains. Made a new SOTA machine learning model? Show it to the world by making a web app!

_Note:_ In case of any doubts while going through this roadmap, You can post your query on the Webdev Channel on the discord server of Programming Club,IIT Kanpur.

## Week 1(Basics)

Let us dive into the world of web development by learning the basics of how the web works and making our first website. This week you’ll be learning about HTML and CSS, which are the basic building blocks of websites.

| Day 1      | Let us start by learning how the web actually works, what does it mean to actually make a website?<br><br>[How does the web work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHvdBlSxug)<br><br>From week 3 we’ll be talking a lot about servers, it helps to know about what exactly is a server.<br><br>[What is a server?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmvM2QtuMU)<br><br>What are the rules that govern the web?<br><br>[Blog on web protocols](https://biratkirat.medium.com/how-does-web-work-7fb8c8a41ae7)<br><br>Note: You don’t need to spend a lot of time here if you know the basics like domain names, DNSs, servers, web browsers, hosting.                                                                                                                           |
| Day 2      | Now let’s actually get started with coding! I recommend you to install VS Code(you can use any other editor that you like, but VSCode has a few extensions that really help) and set it up like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NfFFsQC77M). For Linux users: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)<br><br>Familiarise yourself with the interface and the basic shortcuts (creating a new file, closing the file, saving the file, etc.).<br><br>After this you can start with learning HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage. Learn more from here: [HTML Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg), [HTML text tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) |
| Day 3      | Now you know how to make a website, but it looks really bland, let’s add some style by using [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEV8gMkCHXQ).<br><br>You can learn more about CSS from here: [CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI), [CSS text reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php)<br><br>(NOTE: CSS is vast and you do NOT need to remember all the properties, if you have a gist of what you need to do, you can do a google search to get answers)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Day 4      | CSS can be frustrating at times, especially if you cannot get the things where you want them to be(layouting).<br><br>[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuSz4fRM88) video provides some tips regarding layouting.<br><br>You can practise your CSS skills using this [game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Day 5      | We’ll dive a little bit deeper into CSS, there are a lot of frameworks for writing CSS like bootstrap, tailwind, SASS etc. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouncVBiye_M) video goes over a few of them.<br><br>One of the really helpful tools for making quick UIs is bootstrap, which is especially helpful when you are learning something more advanced and need a UI for testing [Here's a quick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qfEOE4vtxE)<br><br>These are just the basics but feel free to dig deeper as you need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Day 6      | A lot of people struggle with the fact that they can’t come up with good designs, which is totally fine. As a frontend engineer it is NOT your job to come up with designs, that part goes to the UI/UX team, but it does help to know the basic design principles.<br><br>Check this: [Design fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hp_dI0DzY4), [UI Design Blog](https://www.getcloudapp.com/blog/marketing/ui-design/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Day 7      | It’s time to make something on your own! If you have an idea of a website, try making it using HTML and CSS, otherwise, try to clone an existing website like the [PClub Website](https://pclub.in/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Make sure to do the exercise on Day 7 before jumping ahead, building projects is an important part of learning. Don’t forget to share your work on the #web-dev channel on the [PClub discord server](https://discord.gg/azTgV6ZUyx)!

## Week 2(JavaScript)

Finally, a programming language, JavaScript!!!

Now let us start with javascript ie. the language of the web! This is where the more “logical” side of web development starts.

| Day 6      | **Building games in JavaScript**:<br/><br/> JavaScript is now sufficiently familiar to you.<br/><br/> It's time to put your knowledge to use and construct something. I've included a 5-hour lesson on how to create some fun JavaScript games. This can be done over the course of the following two days in two sections.<br/><br/> NOTE: Code while you watch the video and attempt to create some of your own games.<br/><br/> [Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk) (First Part)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Now that you know javascript, try making a [Simon Says Game](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/simon-says.html), without watching any tutorial.

## Week 3(Backend)

Now that you know about the frontend, let’s start working on actual functional websites with a server.

Here we have provided 2 pathways. One through Go and the other through Python(Django). While Golang being fast & scalable is mostly used for developing microservices softwares and cloud computing , on the other hand, Python providing for a huge number of libraries & community support is mostly used for AI,ML and data analysis. You should learn any one of them right now , but after you are done with the roadmap, you are suggested to come back and go-through the alternative pathway too.

**THE GO PATHWAY**

| Day 1      | **Intro to Go**<br><br>First we’ll learn the basics of Golang for developing our entire backend from scratch. Go is a language created by google and is one of the best choices to create scalable backends. [What is Go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=446E-r0rXHI).<br><br>[Go tutorial](https://go.dev/tour/list) (_suggested to complete till_ “_More types: structs, slices, and maps “ for now)_<br><br>**NOTE:** To learn the backend, what's better than starting a project. From now onwards , we will follow the book “Let's Go” by Alex Edwards which is a step-by-step guide to create your first web-application(a Snippetbox- which lets people paste and share snippets of text) in Golang from scratch.<br><br>[**Book is available here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lbDldlXYxUPTAOciiyivg9qswzRPFsQk?usp=share_link)<br><br>In case of any doubts while going through any of the implementations of the above book , it's suggested to go through the [Go documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/std)  |
| Day 2 & 3  | **Foundations**<br><br>We will follow chapter-2 from the Let's Go book. It will guide you right from installing Go on your system.<br><br>**Note:** In case you are already familiar with the VS Code environment, you can continue it as your Go IDE , else you are strongly suggested to [download Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download/#section=windows) as your IDE. You can use an educational licence to access it.<br><br>Then this book will help you to go through the basics of web-applications and then implement how to route requests to multiple , custom HTTP headers.<br><br>Then, you will learn how to integrate HTML pages and various features of frontend like CSS , javascripts that you learnt in previous weeks in this project.<br><br>Suggestion: Write the code (even though it's hard to understand) rather than just Ctrl + C/V.<br><br>Then we will cover chapter-3 of this book. This chapter is a bit small and the major concepts it covers are Dependency Injections and error handling. |
| Day 4      | **Databasing**<br><br>We will cover chapter-4 of this book. Databasing is one of the major parts of creating web-applications.But first lets see [what they are and why are they important](https://www.ramotion.com/blog/database-in-web-app-development/#:~:text=The%20database%20stores%20information%20about,data%20structures%20with%20minimal%20effort.) . This chapter helps you go through an implementation of MySQL database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**What’s Next?**

The world of development is vast and there is a lot to explore, this roadmap is in fact just a beginning in your development journey. If you are interested, we suggest you learn more about Next.js(briefly mentioned in week4), MongoDB(a NoSql database), firebase, APIs, Regular Expressions and PostGre(another SQL database, but much more advanced and prevalent in the industry).

Web Development is a gateway to a lot of opportunities in Open Source. The huge benefit of contributing to open source is that you can network with other developers. This means that you'll meet new people and make friends, collaborate with other developers on projects, find mentors and have an opportunity to learn from each other. [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-open-source-programs-for-students-to-participate/amp/) is a list of competitions for students. We wish you all the best for your journey in web development!
